# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
 Use data to analysis and classify the different campaigns base on launch dates and funding goal.
## Analysis and Challenges
Create the Pivot table to extract the data that we need such as date, category,outcomes and Goal.Then base on the relative condition of pivot table to create the chart, in order to display the fluctuant of data trend. There are using many formula to calculate and classify the huge data.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to the outcomes based on Lauch date, we can find out the trend between failed and successful have simular movement in the chart.
The successful data have maxmium value during the May and June period. In the pivot table can more clearly show up vaule of number relate to different categories.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The sheet can classify the number of successful, failed and cancel base on the different range in the goal setting. In the chart relate from the percentage of successful column and failed column show us the line are oppositely.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges part is for choosing the correct formula.For example, during using the countifs formula to calculate how many successful or failed depend on the criteria. The range of the goal need to be the criteria_range 1 like kickstart!$D$D, "<1000" cannot set as the criteria_rang 2, crieria 2 since the result usually show as the 0.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. In the sheet, the data of the live and cancel is small group on the outcomes.More people are join in the campaigns
    2. According to the data, the successful has 60.2% in the Grand total and the failed has 35.3%. It mean the proportion of the failed occupy more than a half in each month.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    1. The percentage of goal is going down from less than 1000 to 30000 to 39999 that shows the campaigns more hard to reach out the goal range.
    2.The percentage of failed present in the opposite side when the goal range increase that the failed run up.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
In the dataset only calcute the outcomes on the launch date or use the outcomes data to how much goal that need to reach out. Becuase it didn't have inforamtion relate to the main customer for different campaigns. It cannot focus on what kind of target group can affect to the goal of the compaigns.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
we can use the histogram or clustered column to show the data.
